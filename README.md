# IOT-SMART-HOME-APPLICATION
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SMART LOCAL AREA NETWORK FOR IOT SMART HOME APPLICATION

Network communication and micro-electro-mechanical embedded technologies have attracted much attention in recent years. Through these technologies, the capabilities of sensing, identification, and communication can be embedded in various smart devices . These smart devices can automatically connect to the Internet and form an intelligent network called Internet of Things (IoT). However, these devices are embedded with different wireless communication interfaces such as Wi-Fi . The pervasiveness of smart home devices necessitates robust and efficient Local Area Networks (LANs) to ensure seamless communication and data transfer . This project proposes a controlled experiment to investigate the performance characteristics of LANs within a simulated smart home environment. The experiment aims to understand how factors like the number of connected devices, data transfer types, and network congestion affect overall network performance. The collected data will provide valuable insights for optimizing LANs to handle the ever-growing demands of smart home technology.
