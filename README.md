# IoT Smart Home Application
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Smart Local Area Network (LAN) for an IoT-based smart home application. With the rise of network communication and micro-electro-mechanical embedded technologies, smart home devices can seamlessly connect to the Internet and form an intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) network.

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance characteristics of a smart home LAN by simulating various real-world conditions, including device connectivity, data transfer types, and network congestion.
🏠 Smart Home Network Architecture
1️⃣ IoT Network Design

    The smart home environment consists of multiple IoT-enabled devices, such as:
    ✅ Smart sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.)
    ✅ Smart appliances (lights, thermostats, locks, cameras, etc.)
    ✅ Home automation controllers (Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc.)
    ✅ Edge computing devices (Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, etc.)

2️⃣ Wireless Communication Protocols

    IoT devices in the smart home use various wireless communication interfaces, including:
    📶 Wi-Fi → High-speed data transfer for bandwidth-heavy applications
    🔗 Zigbee/Z-Wave → Low-power, short-range communication for sensors
    📡 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) → Efficient for short-range device pairing

3️⃣ LAN Performance Optimization

To ensure seamless communication and data transfer, the smart home LAN is optimized based on:
🚀 Number of connected devices → Evaluating network scalability
📊 Data transfer types → Streaming vs. periodic data transmission
⚡ Network congestion effects → Studying bandwidth allocation and QoS (Quality of Service)
🛠 Implementation & Experimentation
🔍 Controlled Experiment Design

    A simulated smart home environment is set up to analyze network performance.
